                <p>I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. The point is that when I see a
                    sunset or a <a href="#">waterfall</a> or something, for a split second it's so great, because
                    for a little bit I'm out of my brain, and it's got nothing to do with me. I'm not trying to
                    figure it out, you know what I mean? And I wonder if I can somehow find a way to maintain that
                    mind stillness.</p>
