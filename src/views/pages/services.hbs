  <div class="container">
    <!-- WELCOME TEXT -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 wp1">
        <h1 class="arrow">How I add <span>value</span> to the industry</h1><!-- Headline -->
        <!-- about / welcome text -->
        <p><strong>Breaking into this industry is hard, but let me show you what you are missing by passing on junior engineers like myself! <br /></strong>

          <p>Due to the shift in the industry to cut back on junior engineers, I have had to get creative in how I show my value. I have a unique perspective on how people interact with software. After spending years talking to people and helping them through various issues, I like to design and build things that makes sense to people. </p>

          <p>Internship oppertunities are not avalible to someone like me due to living in a small town, and other reasons that can be explore on my About Page. I love creative solutions so I hope I can showcase how I solve these industry issues on my page.</p>

          <p>I take the information that I have gathered through my schooling career to improve and empower my community. What better way to show my capabilites than to give back.</p>

          <p>My small town has a variety of software needs that only engineers can solve to empower the community and life around us. My perspective leaves me in a place where I have the life expierence to see both sides. I am not just a developer, I am a person who wants to make a difference. </p>
          
          <p>How does this work for me? I am glad you asked!</p>

          <p>I start by thinking to myself - what have I struggled with in my community? What tools and education can my community use?</p>

          <p>I have struggled with connecting with others and finding out what is going on in my area. How can I make this better for people?</p>

          <p>My community uses Facebook for most of the social interactions and events. Businesses will default to this platform and everything is controlled by this giant. The upside is that all information is centralized, the downside is that it is not accessible and controlled in a way that sparks misinformation and contension.</p>

          <p>Algorithms push content that may or may not be advantageous to the user. What if I shift that a little to make the information a little more accessible and more in control of the user? Give them a hub for data that is easy to use an understandable.</p>

          <p>My full approach doesnt just consider the code behind the software, but the people too. How can I make this easy for them? </p>
